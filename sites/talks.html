    <h1>How Are These Relevant?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        These talks are relevant to the topic of the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints because they discuss the essential doctrine 
        behind the restoration and first vision. They describe the characteristics of God and also describe how anyone can receive personal revelation from God 
        as long as they are intentful and ask of God. D&C Section 8 is also relevant because it further describes the gift of revelation and how it can help us
        and give us guidance. All of these things are essential to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints because they are the foundational 
        knowledge of the Church. They are some examples of the most basic knowledge.
