        <h3>First Vision</h3>
        <p>Joseph Smith, who restored the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, had a vision of God the Father and Jesus Christ in 1820. During this vision, he was told that none of the churches at
             the time were true and that he would be the person to restore the true gospel of God. This vision was also when Joseph heard the phrase, "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!". This vision was the beginning of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

        <h3>Translation of the Book of Mormon</h3>
        <p>Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon from golden plates that he received from an angel named Moroni. He used a combination of both the Urim and Thummim as well as 
            seer stones. In fact, at times Joseph would place the seer stone in a hat in order to block out light to see better. The Book of Mormon is a record of the ancient 
            inhabitants of the Americas and is considered scripture by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>

        <p>Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery received the Aaronic Priesthood from John the Baptist and the Melchizedek Priesthood from Peter, James, and John. This event restored the authority to act in God's name and perform ordinances such as baptism and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
