        <h3 class="purpose">Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to provide information regarding the restoration of 
            the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. This site will discuss important people, 
            locations, events, and also the revelations and doctrines that were taught during the time. Another

        <h3 class="back-info">Background Information</h3>
        <p>The restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints began with a young boy, Joseph Smith Jr.
             At the age of 12, Joseph Smith was confused about which church to join. He was confused by the different
                teachings and doctrines that were being taught. He then read James 1:5 in the Bible, which states, "If any of you
                lack wisdom, let him ask of God. Therefore one day, he decided to go into the woods and pray to God. He was then
                visited by God the Father and Jesus Christ, who told him to join none of the churches, for they were all wrong.
                This event was the beginning of the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, as he would eventually be
                called to be a prophet of God.
